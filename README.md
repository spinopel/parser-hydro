This script is a PHP library which allows to parse the hydrological code in format KN-15, and convert it to an array of data parameters. KN-15 code	parsed using the syntactic analysis and regular expressions. It solves the problem of parsing the data in the presence of any error in the code KN-15. In addition to the return parameters, the script also displays the interpreted (easy to understand) information of these parameters.
